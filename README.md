# War Card Game

Play a game of [War](https://www.pagat.com/war/war.html "Pagat entry for War card game") in a web browser console.

# Description

Admiral Horatio Nelson and Admiral Pierre Villeneuve fight the [Battle of Trafalgar](https://www.britannica.com/event/Battle-of-Trafalgar-European-history "Encyclopedia Britannica entry for the Battle of Trafalgar") using the children's card game [War](https://www.pagat.com/war/war.html "Pagat entry for War card game") to determine the winner of the naval engagement. Unlike their 1805 battle, Admiral Villeneuve has a fighting chance with cards. Will Admiral Nelson on his flagship [HMS Victory](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Victory-British-ship "Encyclopedia Britannica entry for the HMS Victory") destroy Admiral Villeneuve's French and Spanish fleet? Learn how to play the game below.

The War Card Game is my second project for [General Assembly's](https://generalassemb.ly/ "General Assembly homepage") Software Engineering Immersive program.
