# About

Admiral Horatio Nelson and Admiral Pierre Villeneuve fight the [Battle of Trafalgar](https://www.britannica.com/event/Battle-of-Trafalgar-European-history "Encyclopedia Britannica entry for the Battle of Trafalgar") using the children's card game [War](https://www.pagat.com/war/war.html "Pagat entry for War card game") to determine the winner of the naval engagement. Unlike their 1805 battle, Admiral Villeneuve has a fighting chance with cards. Will Admiral Nelson on his flagship [HMS Victory](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Victory-British-ship "Encyclopedia Britannica entry for the HMS Victory") destroy Admiral Villeneuve's fleet? Learn how to play the game below.

The War Card Game is my second project for [General Assembly's](https://generalassemb.ly/ "General Assembly homepage") Software Engineering Immersive program.
